## Course Planner
This website is a tool for students to create and save long-term plans. It features an account system with encrypted passwords for security, and an interface for creating, modifying, and deleting four and five year plans. Each plan can be customized, with options to select start year, number of years, and whether to include summer courses. Users can add courses to the fall, winter, spring, and (optionally) summer quarters of each year. Along with the course code, users can enter the number of units in each course. The plan will display quarterly and overall unit totals based on this data.

## Motivation
A long term plan is an extremely helpful tool for college students, and many students develop more than one in order to explore possiblities or prepare for different circumstances. Our website helps students keep track of their plans, providing them with a centralized place to store and update all of their long term plans.
